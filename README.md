## About this project
This project is a ReactJS clone of the Spotify web player.

The main idea is to have users be authenticated through Spotify, and then display them some basic information about their own account.

Users can play their own music and control their other connected devices, to play, pause, or skip songs. 

## Taking a look inside

When you first go to app, you get presented with a login page in which you are required to login with your Spotify account in order to proceed to see the web player clone.

After clicking the 'Login with Spotify' button, you will be taken to actual Spotify website where you will authorize this app to see and do things for you.
